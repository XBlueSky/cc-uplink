# Propagate the crate version onto the plugin's two version files.
#
# Cargo.toml is the single source of truth: release-plz bumps it (plus
# Cargo.lock and CHANGELOG.md) and touches nothing else. Two more files carry
# the same number for different reasons:
#
#   plugins/cc-uplink/.claude-plugin/plugin.json     what Claude Code displays
#   plugins/cc-uplink/.claude-plugin/server-version  what launcher.sh downloads
#
# The pin is the dangerous one. launcher.sh resolves it to a GitHub Release
# tarball, so a stale pin means a user installs a new plugin and silently runs
# the old server — the exact skew the pin exists to prevent. Hand-editing three
# files in step is how that drift gets introduced, so release.yml runs this on
# the release PR and ci.yml runs `--check` on every push.
#
#   scripts/sync-versions.sh           rewrite the two files to match Cargo.toml
#   scripts/sync-versions.sh --check   exit 1 if they already disagree
